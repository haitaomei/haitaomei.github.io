<h1>Welcome to Haitao's Homepage!</h1>
<h2> Some quotes I learned:</h2>
<p>Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.</p>
<p>You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. 
    True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint. If words
contorl you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.</p>
